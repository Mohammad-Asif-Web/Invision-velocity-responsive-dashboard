# In their words
Designers working on a responsive web experience need to design across small, medium, and large screen sizes to understand how each component should behave in different scenarios. But not all UI kits support that. The best results in design come when you think about the form and function components have across an app ecosystem. Velocity will take care of that for you—and set you up for a scalable source of design truth.

This dashboard UI kit is a best-in-class example of how to set up a design system. Take your time, dig deep, and learn how you can apply these ideas to your next project. Understanding how shared components make up a design system will speed up your next project.
